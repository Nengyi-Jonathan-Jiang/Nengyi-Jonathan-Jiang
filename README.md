## Hello

I'm a student at SLHS, and I like to code random stuff in my free time. 

## What I code

I code basically anything. Currently, I am making a notes app, working on implementing a MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) algorithm, and writing a compiler for a language I designed, as well as working on a bunch of smaller random projects.

## My stuff

Check out my [personal website](https://nengyi-jonathan-jiang.github.io/) for my stuff
